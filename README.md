# IBDTherapyResponsePaper

This repository contains code used for the analyses in the manuscript "IL-1-driven stromalâ€“neutrophil interactions define a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel disease that does not respond to therapies" by Friedrich, Pohin, and Jackson et al., Nature Medicine, 2021. It is divided into folders, each concerning a different data type or analytical approach. These are briefly outlined below.

## Module_Analyses

This contains the WGCNA analyses used to define the modules in the discovery resection dataset, any analyses done using the modules in the discovery whole tissue RNA-Seq data, and the module replications in the therapy response datasets.

## Resection_Whole_tissue

This contains notebooks used to perform quality control, exploratory analysis, and differential expression in the discovery resection and discovery whole tissue RNA-Seq datasets.

## Cytokines

This contains notebooks used to perform quality control, exploratory analysis, and differential expression in culture-expanded primary stromal cell lines from surgically resected intestinal tissue of IBD patients and stimulated them with a panel of cytokines.

## SmartSeq2

This contains notebooks used to perform quality control, exploratory analysis, and differential expression in FACS-sorted hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell subsets from the intestinal tissue of non-IBD and IBD patients.

## Tenx

This contains all code associated with the analysis of single-cell data.
